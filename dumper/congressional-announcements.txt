*House appointments*

As per the start of the first Congress I'm currently appointing people to the house of representatives until we gain enough members and enough interest into the chamber for elections, please dm myself or ping myself within the discord to talk about gaining a seat.

Kind regards
Speaker, Annalise Keating
